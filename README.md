# ACM-Problem-Picker
<p>Made by CJ Freimund for the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater's Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter.</p>
<h2>Picking Problems for you!</h2>
<p>Have you ever found yourself wondering what problem to work on next?</p>
<p>This Discord Bot is made for those who need a bit of a push in Problem Solving!</p>
<p>Every Monday at noon, this bot will choose a random problem from either LeetCode, Advent of Code, or an ICPC World Finals Competition!</p>

<p>Right now, this bot is being tested primarily in the UWW ACM Discord Server, but if you would also like to test this out in your own servers, feel free!</p>

  <h2>What comes next?</h2>
  <p>One of my biggest passions right now is building the sense of wonder when it comes to problem solving!</p>
  <ul><p>Here are some things I intend on adding in my free time:</p>
    <li>Allowing users to personally set when the bot can post a problem!</li>
    <li>Adding more Problem Sources, and the choice to edit where problems come from!</li>
    <li>Potentially a Leaderboard or Submission counter to reward those who complete and build their problem solving skill!</li>
  </ul>
